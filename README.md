## Confirmed coronavirus cases in Europe countries (EBU)

Concerns about the new coronavirus linger over Europe as the UK declared a “serious and imminent threat” to public health on Monday morning. The step allows extra measures, such as enforcing quarantine, to be taken by doctors to fight the spread of the disease, and was announced along with four new cases bringing the total number of cases to eight in the UK.

Meanwhile, the EU has scheduled a special meeting of health ministers. Issues on the agenda are the possibility of coordinating border controls, shortages of medicine due to production disruptions in China, and the stepping up of efforts to develop a vaccination against the disease.

This map shows the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Europe from January 22 until February 22 included.

The data has been sourced from the World Health Organisation and was compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. See, [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
